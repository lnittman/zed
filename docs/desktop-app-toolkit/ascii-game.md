# ASCII Game Example

This example project demonstrates building a lightweight desktop game using the same tools that power Zed.

## Overview
- Standalone application [`ascii_game`](../../apps/ascii_game) renders its UI with [`gpui`](../../crates/gpui).
- Scenes and choices are generated by the Gemini 2.5 Flash model through OpenRouter using the [`open_ai`](../../crates/open_ai) client.

## Wireframe

```
+-------------------------------+
| Rusty Quest                   |
|                               |
| > 1. Explore the forest       |
| > 2. Check inventory          |
| > 3. Rest at camp             |
+-------------------------------+
```

## Prompt Template

```text
<instructions>
You are the narrator of a fantasy adventure.
Return an ASCII scene describing the player's surroundings and a numbered list of actions.
Include only text inside <scene> tags.
</instructions>
```

## Example Response

```
<scene>
   ~ The Moonlit Clearing ~
   A gentle breeze rustles the leaves.
   1. Follow the path north
   2. Investigate the glowing stone
   3. Open your map
</scene>
```

Structured responses keep the game logic small while allowing the model to improvise.

## Storyline Seeds

Providing the model with seed instructions lets you branch the adventure in unique ways. For example:

```text
<instructions>
The hero is tracking a lost relic through a haunted forest.
Include a short description of the hero's feelings.
</instructions>
```

The returned scene might incorporate that theme while still returning numbered options.
