# AGENTS Guide for `docs`

This directory contains documentation for building Rust-based native desktop applications, inspired by the Zed codebase. The goal is to provide a toolkit for quickly bootstrapping new desktop apps using the patterns and packages found here.

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Serve as a reference for developers looking to create high-performance desktop apps in Rust.
- **Scope**: Covers architecture, package organization, AI integrations, and design system usage based on Zed's implementation.
- **Audience**: Rust developers familiar with the language but new to large-scale desktop development.

## Development Workflow
- Build documentation locally with `mdbook serve docs` (requires `mdbook`).
- Keep examples minimal and cross-platform.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Update or add docs incrementally.
- Reference relevant code paths when possible to keep documentation verifiable.
- No tests or linting are required for doc changes unless specifically requested.
